  Creating randomness is a non-trivial problem to be solved in blockchain systems. 
</GradientTextWrapp>

In daily life, we use the term random very loosely. We use it whenever we do not have a quick explanation expressing the statistical probability of a particular event happening. This leads to wrong assumptions and false predictions. This is fatal when used in blockchains as everyone has access to the same data and pseudo randomness could be easily detected and used to trick your smart contract or application.
