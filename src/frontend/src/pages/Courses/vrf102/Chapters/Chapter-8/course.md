#####Chapter 8:

# Conclusion

Congrats! You learned more about how randomness works in computer systems and especially blockchains. We then looked into Verifiable Random Functions in more detail to better understand how Chainlink implements and uses them. Finally, we got more practical and learned how to use VRFv2 programmatically and make simultaneous requests and studied potential issues you must consider when implementing your solution.

Future courses will focus on building complete applications and explaining features in more depth. You now have the “know-how” on how to get a verifiable, secure random number for use in a smart contract and understand more about the fundamentals!
