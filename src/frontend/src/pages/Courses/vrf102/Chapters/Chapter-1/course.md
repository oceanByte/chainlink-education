      In daily life, we use the term random very loosely. We use it whenever we do not have a quick explanation expressing the statistical probability of a particular event happening. This leads to wrong assumptions and false predictions.

Let’s take the Monte Carlo fallacy as an example. It describes the mistaken belief that past events that occur more often than others are less likely to happen in the future (or vice versa) though they are statistically independent. If you play roulette in a casino and see that red has appeared ten times behind in a row, you might believe that it’s more likely that the next color will be black. But as soon as you apply statistics, you must admit that there is no reason to assume that the next color is more likely to be black. The occurrence is random.

Several other fallacies should make us very cautious in trusting our intuitive understanding of statistics and randomness. As dependencies get more complex or hidden and the numbers increase, we tend to lose the ability to assess probabilities correctly and intuitively. So we will look a little deeper into randomness and the difficulty for deterministic systems like blockchains to create randomness at the beginning of this course. Once we understand the challenges, we will look into potential solutions to this problem and especially learn more about Verifiable Random Functions. Equipped with this new knowledge, we will get practical and will understand how to create subscriptions and add consumer contracts programmatically. At this point, you should have a good understanding of randomness and how to use VRF v2 in your applications. So the final chapters will focus on common pitfalls you should avoid while using VRF v2.
