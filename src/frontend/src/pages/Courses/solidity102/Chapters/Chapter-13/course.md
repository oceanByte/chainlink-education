     Chainlink can be used for a lot more than dynamic NFTs. Whenever you need to connect the off-chain world to the on-chain world, Chainlink is the perfect solution.

Congrats for making it this far! That’s a lot of Solidity concepts! The main gist of this course is that there are really only two things you are ever defining when programming smart contracts (or just programming in general): state (variables) and logic (functions). In future courses, we will go into more detail on more complex variables such as storing structs within arrays and more special functions such as the constructor and events. And as always, you know the best way to learn is by doing! Feel free to go to https://remix.ethereum.org/, and just mess around with writing code there. It may feel overwhelming at first, but don’t worry it’s just to get a feel for what’s to come!
