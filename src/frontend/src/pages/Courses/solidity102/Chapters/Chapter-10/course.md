# Conclusion

That’s a lot of Solidity concepts! Congrats for making it this far. You know the best way to learn is by getting your hands dirty. So head over to https://remix.ethereum.org/ and mess around with writing code there. It may feel overwhelming with all the new concepts in mind, but it’s a great way to explore the freshly learned concepts further.
Future courses will look into specific use cases from DeFi, NFTs and DAOs. We will also cover developing a dApp interacting with the deployed contracts.
