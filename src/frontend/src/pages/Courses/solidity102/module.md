# Solidity Introduction

  Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Learn about the basics here.

In Solidity 101 we learned about the basics of smart contracts in Solidity. We looked into the Ethereum Virtual Machine and how it deals with state (variables) and logic (functions). Basic concepts like the minimal structure of a contract and how to write functions to manipulate values. And we learned about data types, operators and looked into more depth into arrays.

In this course, we want to dive deeper and expand our knowledge and learn about futher basics like conditional statements, loops and complex data structures like arrays and maps. In the second part, we will see how data is stored and variables handled in contracts. Next, we will learn how to handle errors in Solidity.

The best way to learn to program is to program! With that said, let's dive right in!
