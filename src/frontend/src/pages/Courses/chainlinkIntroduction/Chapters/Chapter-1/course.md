Chainlink, smart contracts, blockchains, and the entire world of cryptocurrency have been a hot topic of discussion for several years now. Whether it’s companies like [EY and Microsoft](https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/ey-and-consensys-announce-formation-of-baseline-protocol-initiative-to-make-ethereum-mainnet-safe-and-effective-for-enterprises/) looking to use smart contracts to improve their business processes, artists and athletes like [LaMelo Ball](https://blog.ether.cards/lamelo-ball-nft/) creating their own “NFTs,” or up and coming companies looking to disrupt long-standing establishments such as the [insurance](https://www.arbolmarket.com/) industry, Chainlink and smart contracts are working to become the backbone for world-changing applications.

## What is Web 3.0?

In Web 1.0, the internet was a static place where web pages and content were created and owned by a single entity (i.e., a website for the news such as the New York Times, where they curated and owned all articles). In Web 2.0, which we are currently moving away from, applications are created to allow users to create their own content on web pages. This content and the web page are still owned by a single entity (think users creating content on Facebook). These web pages are well known as “Web Apps”.

Web 2.0 isn’t a fair, equitable place for the users generating all this content and data. The centralized entities who control these web apps can and have un-equitably profited from all the content that their users  generated. Enter Web 3.0: the future of the internet we are moving towards. In Web 3.0, web apps (and the content generated within them) can be created and not be controlled by any centralized entity. These decentralized apps, or Dapps, are completely open and transparent, and can distribute any generated profits more equitably.

The future of the internet, dubbed Web 3.0, is being built in front of our eyes so let's dive in and start building the future!
