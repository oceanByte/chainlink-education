## What is Web 3.0?

In Web 1.0, the internet was a static place where web pages and content were created and owned by a single entity (i.e. a website for the news such as the New York Times where they curated and owned all articles). In Web 2.0, which we are currently moving away from, applications are created to allow users to create their own content on web pages.This content and the web page are still owned by a single entity (think users creating content on Facebook). These web pages are well known as “Web Apps”.

Web 2.0 isn’t a fair, equitable place for the users generating all this content and data. The centralized entities who control these web apps can and have un-equitably profited from all the content that was generated by their users. Enter Web 3.0: the future of the internet we are moving towards. In Web 3.0, web apps (and the content generated within them) can be created and not be controlled by any centralized entity. These decentralized apps, or Dapps, are completely open and transparent, and can distribute any generated  profits  in a more equitable fashion.

The future of the internet, dubbed Web 3.0, is being built in front of our eyes so let's dive in and start building the future!
