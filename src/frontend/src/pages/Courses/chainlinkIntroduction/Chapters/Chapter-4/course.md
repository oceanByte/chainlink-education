Smart contracts result from the evolution of digital agreements. A Smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement being directly written into computer code. Smart contracts provide the following benefits:

  <div class="wrapp">
    <p class="list__label"><b>Reliable, Guaranteed Execution</b></p>
    <ul class="list__items">
      <li class="list__item">
        <p>
   In traditional agreements, the execution and enforcement of the terms detailed within the contract is highly dependent on the signing parties; this may not happen immediately or at all.   In terms of smart contracts, none of the parties have control over the execution or enforcement of contract terms.
   <b>Example:</b> In the insurance industry, the contract isn’t immediately executed after the conditions have been met. Rather, a lengthy review process is initiated and it could take months, even years before a contract is executed.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
    <div class="wrapp">
    <p class="list__label"><b>Transparency</b></p>
    <ul class="list__items">
      <li class="list__item">
        <p>
          Traditional agreements can be opaque and difficult to access in an attempt to obscure details from users. Smart contracts are transparent and open to the public by default.
          <b>Example</b>: If the opaque Collaterlize Debt Obligations (CDOs) that played a large role in the 2008 financial crisis were programmed as smart contracts, they would be completely transparent and any member of the public would have had the ability to audit them.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="wrapp">
    <p class="list__label"><b>Tamper-Proofness</b></p>
    <ul class="list__items">
      <li class="list__item">
        <p>
        Smart contracts reduce counterparty risk since neither party has control over the execution of an agreement.  
        <b>Example:</b> An equities exchange platform would not be able to stop someone from using their platform unless explicitly coded into the smart contract.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="wrapp">
    <p class="list__label"><b>Trust Minimization</b></p>
    <ul class="list__items">
      <li class="list__item">
        <p>
          Smart contracts reduce counterparty risk since neither party has control over the execution of an agreement.
          <b>Example</b>: Robinhood can no longer stop people from trading Gamestop, unless it is coded into the agreement.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="list__label">Efficiency:</p>
    <ul class="list__items">
      <li class="list__item">
        <p>
         The characteristics of smart contracts outlined earlier can create more efficient, automated processes that save business cost. 
         <b>Example:</b> Businesses could use a smart contract to settle inter-company transactions without needing to spend time and money on complicated systems of trusted neutral third parties to hold both sides accountable.

The previous section explained the beneficial properties of smart contracts, but how can self-executing code that doesn’t rely on a trusted intermediary be created and implemented? To achieve this feat, another technology was invented: the <ColorWord>blockchain</ColorWord>. A blockchain is a global network of computers that stores data and transactions in a shared ledger that is <i>decentralized</i>. This means that the ledger isn’t controlled by anyone. Essentially, a blockchain can be compared to a database that is replicated over many computers all over the world secured with the use of cryptography and game theory (a combination of math and sociology).

You may have heard of a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. Bitcoin is built on a blockchain (referred to as the <i>Bitcoin blockchain</i>)! No one entity controls Bitcoin so it can be thought of as a sort of “proto-smartcontract”. It has all the properties of smart contracts listed before, but only has one use: transferring value between individuals.

Today, there are blockchains where <i>any</i> code or applications can be built from. The code deployed to a blockchain is indeed a Smart Contract. This ability was truly pioneered by the Ethereum blockchain, but there are many other blockchains such as Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, Terra, and many others have the same capability. Smart contracts are often written in a programming language called <ColorWord>Solidity</ColorWord>, but others such as Rust are gaining popularity.
