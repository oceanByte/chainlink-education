Smart contacts result from the evolution of digital agreements. A Smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement being directly written into computer code.  Smart contracts provide the following benefits:

          Many smart contracts have been live for years without security breaches or concerns.. A well designed smart contract cannot be easily changed after it is deployed.

          In traditional agreements, the execution and enforcement of the terms detailed within the contract is highly dependent on the signing parties; this may not happen immediately or at all.   In terms of smart contracts, none of the parties have control over the execution or enforcement of contract terms. <br/>
          <b>Example</b>: In the insurance industry, the contract isn’t immediately executed after the conditions have been met. Rather, a lengthy review process is initiated and it could take months, even years, before a contract is executed.

          Smart contracts reduce counterparty risk since neither party has control over the execution of an agreement. <br/>

## Blockchain Introduction

The previous section explained the beneficial properties of smart contracts, but how can self-executing code that doesn’t rely on a trusted intermediary be created and implemented? To achieve this feat, another technology was invented: the <ColorWord>blockchain</ColorWord>. A blockchain is a global network of computers that stores data and transactions in a shared ledger that is <i>decentralized</i>. This means that the ledger isn’t controlled by anyone. Essentially, a blockchain can be compared to a database that is replicated over many computers all over the world secured with the use of cryptography and game theory (a combination of math and sociology).

You may have heard of a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. Bitcoin is built on a blockchain (referred to as the <i>Bitcoin blockchain</i>)! No one entity controls Bitcoin so it can be thought of as a sort of “proto-smartcontract”. It has all the properties of smart contracts listed before, but only has one use: transferring value between individuals. 

Today, there are blockchains where <i>any</i> code or applications can be built from. The code deployed to a blockchain is indeed a Smart Contract.  This ability was truly pioneered by the Ethereum blockchain, but there are many other blockchains such as Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, Terra, and many others have the same capability. Smart contracts are often written in a programming language called <ColorWord>Solidity</ColorWord>, but others such as Rust are gaining popularity.
