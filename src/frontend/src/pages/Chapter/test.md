#####Chapter 1:

What will this course cover?
=============================

***Chainlink, smart contracts, blockchains, and the entire world of cryptocurrency have been a hot topic of discussion for several years now.***

Whether it’s companies like EY and Microsoft looking to use smart contracts to improve their business processes, artists and athletes like LaMelo Ball creating their own“NFTs”, or up and coming companies looking to disrupt long standing industries such as insurance, Chainlink and smart contracts are looking to be the backbone for world changing applications.

The future of the internet, dubbed Web3.0, is being built in front of our eyes so let's dive in and start building the future! But wait, Chainlink? Smart contracts? Doesn’t blockchain have something to do with that Bitcoin stuff some people buy? In this course we will build up the intuition on what Chianlink is and the problems it solves.

## What are Contracts?
Agreements, deals, promises; these are concepts that humans seem to universally have an intuition on across cultures. Maybe as a child you agreed to trade 3 of your toys for 1 friend’s rare toy.

Or maybe you’ve agreed to lend your car to your friend as long as they don’t put more than 100 miles on it and bring it back with a full tank. Or maybe you make an agreement with your health coach that you wont eat more than 2,500 calories a day.

    These are all examples of agreements and agreements can be spoken orally, written down on paper, or even typed in digital documents. Enforcement of agreements are handled outside of courts: you will probably lose trust in your friend who brings back your car with 600 miles on it and an almost empty tank of gas.

Your health coach will be very disappointed in you if you’ve eaten 5,000 calories a day for the past week. Thus enforcement of standard agreements is often kind of “wishy washy” and based on many hard measure factors such as reputation impact.

Contracts are agreements that are enforceable in a court of law. Maybe you’ve signed a leasing contract to rent an apartment or house. Perhaps you’ve run a restaurant and signed a futures contract with food suppliers to get corn at a specific price and time no matter what happens in the corn market.

Or perhaps you’ve signed an employment agreement with the company you work for on what your pay rate will be and what benefits you will have. Either way, once these contractual agreements have been made it is expected that if they are not executed how they were written they will be enforced by a court of law i.e. a government and the power they have.
