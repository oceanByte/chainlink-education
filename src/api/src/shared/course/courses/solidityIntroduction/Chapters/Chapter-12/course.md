In the last chapter we built a function that added two numbers. But within that function, we actually used a + (plus sign) to add the numbers. The plus sign is another operator, just like the equals sign assignment operator, and the logic it runs is intuitively to add numbers! There are actually quite a few pre-build operators in Solidity you can utilize to make programming smart contracts that much easier. Here are some useful operators in the Arithimetic and Relational catagories:

**Arithmetic Operators: These operators perfom basics arithmetic operations**

* Addittion (+): Used to add two Numbers
* Subtraction (-): Used to subtract two Numbers
* Multiplication (*): Used to Multiply two Numbers
* Division (/): Used to divide a number by another number
* Modulus (%): Returns the remainder after division
* Increment (++): Increases an interger by 1
* Decrement (--): Decreases an interger by 1

Relational Operators: These operators are used to compare values

* Equal (==): Check if values are equal, if they are it returns true (1) and if not returns false (0)
* Not Equal (!=): Check if values are unequal, if they are it returns true (1) and if not returns false (0)
* Greater Than (>): Check if left value is greater than right, if it is, it returns true (1) and if not returns false (0)
* Less Than (<): Check if left value is less than right, if it is, it returns true (1) and if not returns false (0)
* Greater than or Equal to (>=): Check if left value is greater than or equal to right, if it is, it returns true (1) and if not returns false (0)
* Less than or equal to (<=): Check if left value is less than or equal to right, if it is, it returns true (1) and if not returns false (0)

These should be good for now! We’ll dive into more operators in a future course.
