Now we will give our smart contract a name. The classic first programming exercise is called “HelloWorld” but this is Web3 so lets call it “HelloWeb3”. To name a contract, you type the keyword <Highlight class="language-javascript">contract</Highlight> followed by the name. You then put a set of curly braces beside it. Here’s an example: 

<Highlight class="language-javascript">
contract HelloWeb3{

}

</Highlight>

Everything within the curly braces is considered part of the HelloWeb3 smart contract. Try completing the contract on the right with the name “HelloWeb3”.
